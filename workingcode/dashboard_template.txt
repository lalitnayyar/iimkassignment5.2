## Instructions to Generate Visualizations

1. First, run the Python script to generate all visualizations:

   python Sales_Dashboard.py
   ```

   - sales_by_country.png

3. The visualizations follow the 4C's principles:
   - Clear: Easy to understand and interpret

   - Concise: Focused on key information
   - Captivating: Visually engaging and memorable
